#Map Note App

This is a mobile application developed using React Native. The app integrates Google Maps to help users manage and track their locations. Users can select desired points on the map, add notes about these locations, and view a list of their notes. Firebase integration allows for user profile creation, profile photo changes, and user login/logout functionality. Additionally, users can switch between different map types. The app also utilizes React Navigation for stack and tab navigation, and includes various helper libraries for enhanced functionality.
